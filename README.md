## About the Project

A service where users can search for news articles and save them to their profiles.

### Key Features

- When the user enters a keyword in the search bar, the website sends a request to the News API service, finds all the relevant articles over the last week, and displays a list of cards for each of them.
- It displays all articles a user saves in a special section of the website.

### Technologies Used

- **React:** Hooks and Context
- **HTML5 & CSS3:** BEM structure
- **News API Integration:** Real-time data.
